What that means is that there is no way the site can cheat you by picking numbers to make you lose.  You can take our word for it, but for the crypto-nerds out there, here are the gory details:</p><p>When you click 'randomize' in the top right we make up a secret random string (the server seed) that is used to randomize the rolls.  You are shown the hash of the server seed, and are asked to supply your own random number (the client seed) to further randomize the rolls.</p><p>The sha256 hash of the server seed you are currently using is:<div class="monospace"><span id="shash"></span></div></p><p>The client seed currently in use:<div class="monospace"><span id="seed"></span></div></p><p>and the number of bets you have made using it:<div class="monospace"><span id="nonce"></span></div></p><p>Each time you roll, the server and client seeds are combined with the number of rolls you have made since the seeds were selected to create the roll.</p><p>Notice that you are shown the hash of the server seed <em>before</em> picking your client seed.  This ensures that there is no way we can influence the numbers you will roll.</p><h3>Instant Verification with a Single Seed</h3><p>If you want to verify that we are not cheating you, click 'randomize' again to reveal the current server seed and generate a new pair of seeds for future rolls.</p><!-- p You can then verify that it hashes to the hash we previously showed you, and that when combined with your client seed it generates the correct sequence of rolls.--><p>In this way you can verify your rolls whenever you like, without having to wait for a daily secret to be published, and you are safe from cheating without the need to set a different client seed for each bet you make.</p><h3>Details</h3><p>To generate your dice rolls, we string together your client seed, a colon, and your bet number.</p><p>For example, if your client seed is 1234567 and you are about to make your first roll since setting the seed, we will use "1234567:1".</p><p>We then use the hmac-sha512() function to hash that string with the server seed.  That gives us a 128 character hex string.</p><p>Note that the "bet number" in both the above cases is the number of bets you have made since your seeds were selected, not the global server "bet ID" number.</p><p>We then take the first 5 characters of that hex string and convert them to a decimal integer (that will be in the range 0 through 1048575 (16^5-1)).</p><p>If it is less than 1 million, we divide it by 10,000 and use it as your dice roll.  That is the case 96% of the time.</p><p>Otherwise we use the next five characters of the 128 character hex string, and repeat.</p><p>In the unlikely event that none of the 25 groups of five characters are lower than 1 million when convered to decimal, we use the remaining 3 hex digits, which give a number in the range 0 through 4095, which corresponds to a dice roll of 0.0000 through 0.4095.</p><h3>Verifier</h3><p>A few players on the site collaborated to create services you can use to verify your rolled numbers:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://rgbkey.github.io/just-dice/">RGBkey</a></li><!-- li: a(target="_blank", href="http://nixbot.info/Verifier/") nixbot--><li><a target="_blank" href="http://jsfiddle.net/usrfyxn0/show/">jsfiddle</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="misc/just-dice.py.txt">just-dice.py</a> (a Python3 script by <a target="_blank" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=586751.msg10193222#msg10193222">marilyn</a> that you can run offline)</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/VolosStorm/JD-Roll-Verifier">Titanium</a> (userid 77) made a standalone node.js verifier</li></ul><p>Copy the 3-line value from the 'randomize' window into the first input of those pages and click 'verify' for a list of the numbers you rolled, calculated independently of the site.</p></div></div><div id="account"><div class="panel"><h3>Security Information</h3><p>To log in to a different account: user (case sensitive): <input id="myuser" class="typing"> pass: <input id="mypass" type="password" class="typing"> google auth: <input id="mycode" class="typing"><button id="myok">login</button><div id="login_error"></div></p><p>An account was automatically created when you first visited the site.<br>If you have cookies enabled, you will be automatically logged in each time you visit from this computer.</p><p>Your user ID is <span id="uid"></span>.</p><div id="login"></div><p>Specify an emergency withdrawal address.<br>Please make an effort to keep this up to date as your funds will be sent to it without warning in the event of an emergency:<br><input id="btcaddr" size="40" class="typing autowidth"> <button class="edit_locked"></button></p><p>Optionally, you can tell us your email address so we can contact you if necessary:<br><input id="emailaddr" size="40" class="typing autowidth"> <button class="edit_locked"></button></p><p>You are shown on-site as <span id="nick"></span><button id="name">edit</button></p><p>Google Authenticator is <span id="ga_status"></span><button id="ga_edit">edit</button><blockquote><div id="ga_info"></div></blockquote></p><p>You have<span id="api_num"></span>API keys<button id="api_edit">manage</button>(coming soon)</p><p><button id="reset_profit">reset profit</button> this will reset your displayed betting profit to zero</p><p><button id="forget_max_warning">enable max bet warning</button> this will forget any "don't ask me again" setting for the max bet warning</p><button id="logout">logout</button><h3>Settings</h3><p>The values you type into the settings fields are automatically saved on the server as you type them.

This both increases the maximum bets on the site, and you keep any profits made.  You also 'keep' any losses.</p><p>Although we have a 1% house edge, and in the long run will earn a profit of 1% of the wagered amount, in the short to medium term we can still lose money. In times when we are lucky, we win many bets and earn a larger-than-expected profit, and in unlucky times we earn less than expected, and can even lose out. This is especially so if someone comes in and makes a large number of massive bets; we can either gain a lot or lose a lot. <b>If you believe that the potential gains do not outweigh the potential losses, please do not invest.</b></p><p>Let's break it down:  Suppose the total bankroll is currently made of 90 CLAM from a single investor, and you invest a further 10 CLAM. You will have 10% of the new 'current bankroll', and the first investor's share will drop from 100% to 90%. Each bet that a player makes is played against the current bankroll. As players win and lose, your investment grows or shrinks by 10% of the overall house profit. When you withdraw your investment you get 10% of the current bankroll. You may withdraw your investment at any time. Other players' investments will affect the percentage of the current bankroll that your investment represents.  If a 3rd investor then invests another 100 CLAM, bringing the total bankroll to 200 CLAM, the first investor's percentage drops from 90% to 45%, your percentage drops from 10% to 5%, and the new investor's percentage is 50%.  Then if a player loses 20 CLAM to the site, everyone's investment grows in proportion.  Your 10 CLAM investment is now 5% of the new bankroll (220 CLAM) ie. 11 CLAM.</p><p>On each bet, each player can profit by up to 0.5% of the total amount invested.  The maximum bet is dynamically adjusted after each bet.  In January 2015 a feature was added to allow investors limit their counterparty risk by declaring some of their invested coins to be offsite. See 'What is "offsite investment"?' in the FAQ tab for details.</p><p>A simple example: The site's bankroll is 90 CLAM.  You invest 10 CLAM, bringing the total bankroll up to 100 CLAM.  A player bets 1 CLAM and loses.  The total bankroll is now 101 CLAM.  You withdraw your investment, and get 10.1 CLAM.  The site's bankroll is now 90.9 CLAM.</p><p>Alternatively: You invest the same 10 CLAM and the same player bets 1 CLAM at a 2x multiplier and wins.  The total bankroll is now 99 CLAM.  Your investment is now only worth 9.9 CLAM.  You can withdraw it now and take the loss, or wait for the law of large numbers to work in your favour.  In the long run you can expect to profit 1% of everything bet against your investment.</p><p>The site currently charges a 10% commission on net investment and staking profits.  The commission rate is subject to change.  Notice will be given in this paragraph 7 clear days before any rate change takes effect.</p><p>Commission is charged when profits are divested, or at midnight (UTC) on Sunday each week, whichever happens sooner.  Commission is never charged twice on the same profits.  For example if you invest 100 CLAM and it grows to 110 CLAM by the end of the first week, you will be charged 10% of your 10 CLAM profit.  If your remaining 109 CLAM investment then shrinks to 105 CLAM over the next week, you will not be charged any commission at the end of that week.  And then, if it grows to 119 CLAM by the end of the 3rd week, you will only be charged 10% commission on the new 10 CLAM of profit over the previous high of 109 CLAM.  At any point you could divest up to your original investment of 100 CLAM without being charged commission since we consider that when divesting you divest the original investment first, and profits later.</p><p>Please help advertise the site.

Pick your chance to win and how much to bet, then select "hi or lo" to roll the dice and get an instant result, win or lose. There is also a live chat where you can interact with other players on the site.  They will probably try to convince you to bet more.  :)</p><p>Alternatively you can invest in the site's bankroll, and share in the site's profits (or losses), while helping us offer bigger maximum bets to the players.  This is why the players in the chat are trying to convince you to bet more - they win when you lose...</p><h4><a name="a2" href="#q2">What does 1% house edge mean?</a></h4><p>Some people have been confused by this.  They ask when we take the 1% off, is it after each win, or when they try to withdraw.  It is neither of these.  The house edge is built in to the payouts.  When you play the 50% game and win, you receive 1.98 times your stake as your payout.  If there was no house edge, you would receive 2 times your stake.  1.98 is 1% less than 2.  That is the house edge.</p><h4><a name="a3" href="#q3">What is CLAM and how do I get some?</a></h4><p>CLAM is a widely distributed decentralised proof-of-stake digital currency.  See <a href="http://clamclient.com/" target="_blank">the official website</a> or <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=623147" target="_blank">the forum thread</a> for an introduction.</p><p>The CLAM project was launched back in May of 2014. Every Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin address that had a non-dust balance in early May was given 4.6 CLAMs for free, and that is how all the CLAMs were initially distributed. If you have a BTC, LTC, or DOGE wallet that was funded in May, you already have some CLAM. Type /dig in the chat tab for more details.</p><p><a href="https://www.poloniex.com/exchange/btc_clam" target="_blank">Poloniex</a> is the exchange with the biggest CLAM/BTC market. See <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/clams/#markets" target="_blank">coinmarketcap</a> for a list of the other markets.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.coinimal.com/?ref=8657176732792397663">Coinimal</a> allows you to quickly buy CLAM for Euros, using SOFORT, GIROPAY, EPS, SEPA, and OBT payment methods.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift</a> offers a service that allows you to convert many different coins (including BTC) to and from CLAM.</p><p>Also, there is a faucet where you can get a fraction of a CLAM for free:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://cryptospout.com/faucet/hourly_clamcoin_faucet.html">cryptospout</a></li></ul><p>Please let me know if any of these links stops working, or if you find another CLAM faucet.</p><h4><a name="a26" href="#q26">How do I get my free CLAMs?</a></h4><p>On the 12th of May 2014 a snapshot was taken of the BTC, LTC, and DOGE blockchains. All addresses bearing a non-dust amount at that point in time were given 4.60545574 CLAMs for free. This was the initial distribution of CLAMs, and it how all the CLAMs were created. The intent was to make the distribution as fair as possible, since everyone involved in any of those three coins automatically got free CLAMs.</p><p>The specific blocks at which the snapshots were taken:</p><pre>   BTC block 300377 (2014-05-12 12:48:17)
   LTC block 565693 (2014-05-12 13:06:31)
  DOGE block 218556 (2014-05-12 13:09:17)</pre><p>In order to access your free CLAMs, you need to be able to sign a transaction using the private key for the BTC, LTC, or DOGE address that owns the CLAMs. Chances are, if you were using one of these coins back in May, you have a wallet.dat file containing tens or maybe even hundreds of addresses (including hidden 'change' addresses which you may not even be aware of), all of which possibly have free CLAMs associated with them.</p><p>The easiest way to collect those CLAMs is to make sure the wallet is now empty by moving any balance into a new wallet, and then import the wallet.dat file into the official CLAM client. It will scan the old wallet.dat file and dig up all the CLAMs.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the /dig command in the chat tab of this site:</p><p>Type<span>/dig</span>for a brief guide.</p><p>Type<span>/dig ADDRESS</span>to check whether there are any free CLAMs available at the given address, and whether they have already been claimed or not.</p><p>Type<span>/dig ADDRESS PRIVKEY</span>to claim the CLAMs at the given address and have them sent to your deposit address at Just-Dice. PRIVKEY is the associated private key in WIF or hex format.</p><p>Keys in WIF format are 51 or 52 characters long, and start with a 5, K, or L for BTC, a 6 or T for LTC and a 6 or Q for DOGE; keys in hex format are 64 characters in the range 0-9 and A-F.</p><p>Any private keys you provide will be used once each to sign a transaction and broadcast it to the CLAM network, then it will be discarded. Private keys are not logged by Just-Dice, but you do need to trust us on that! It is really best to only provide private keys that are empty, and which you do not intend to use again.</p><h4><a name="a27" href="#q27">STAKE: we just staked 1.0000 CLAM - What does this mean?</a></h4><p>Being a proof-of-stake coin means that just by holding coins the site earns rewards for staking blocks. All of the rewards earned from staking are added to the site's bankroll for players to play against and win. Only onsite investment amounts are considered when sharing out staking rewards. 10% commission is charged on staking rewards before they are shared out rather than on divesting or at the end of the week.</p><p>The rewards earned from staking do not show up in the site's overall profit, or in the site profit percentage but they do show up in each individual investor's profit stat. This allows us to compare the site's profit from players with the expectation. We expect the site profit to tend to 1% of the wagered amount over time.</p><h4><a name="a30" href="#q30">What is "offsite investment"?</a></h4><p>In order to allow investors to reduce their counterparty risk, it is possible to have some of their offsite coins treated as if they were invested in the bankroll.</p><p>Suppose you have 1000 coins. You could send them to your deposit address and invest them all. You would now be entrusting your whole 1000 coins to Just-Dice, with the associated risks. Alternatively, you could deposit just 100 of them, invest them, and then tell the site "I have 900 more coins that I want to invest". You keep those coins safe in your own wallet, but they are counted as part of the Just-Dice bankroll. Your share of the bankroll and your share of the site's profits and losses is the same as if you had invested your whole 1000 coins. If the site should have a run of bad luck such that your 100 coins shrinks and you can no longer afford to sustain a single maximum profit loss, your 900 "offsite" coins will be forgotten about. Your investment will then be whatever remains of your initial 100 coin deposit. In that way you can never get into debt with the site.</p><p>Note that the site always sets the maximum profit per bet to 0.5% of the total effective bankroll (ie. onsite plus offsite). So in the above example you invest 100 coins and declare 900 "offsite" coins and your contribution to the effective bankroll is 1000 coins. Therefore you are contributing 0.5% of that, or 5 coins to the site's maximum profit per bet. In other words you are risking 5% of your 100 coin deposit per roll. This is a dangerous move if you don't really have 1000 coins in total, and could result in you losing your 100 coin investment very quickly. Also note that only onsite coins qualify to share in the site's staking rewards.</p><p>To declare offsite coins, deposit and invest as usual, then use the <span>/offsite</span> command in the chat tab, followed by the number of coins you have offsite. For example <span>/offsite 900</span> tells the site "I have 900 coins offsite that I want to consider invested". The <span>/offsite</span> command can be used up to 5 times in any 24 hour period, with the exception that you can use <span>/offsite 0</span> to cancel your offsite investment at any time. You can use <span>/offsite 25x</span> to set your offsite investment amount such that your total investment (onsite+offsite) is 25 times your onsite amount (this is a one-time setting; your offsite amount will remain constant so the ratio won't stay at 25x as your onsite amount will change), or <span>/offsite max</span> to declare the maximum amount of offsite coins; this may cause you to lose half of your invested play coins the first time anyone wins a big bet.</p><p>The <span>/offsite</span> command will require a 2FA code if you have 2FA configured to be required for "divest" actions.</p><p>Note that this new offsite investment feature is experimental and subject to change at any time. If you have any constructive feedback regarding the feature please reply to <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=238613.msg10211985#msg10211985" target="_blank">this post</a> on the BitcoinTalk forums.</p><p>To enable offsite investing please acknowledge that you have read this FAQ answer by typing <span>/enable_offsite_invest</span> in the chat tab.</p><h4><a name="a32" href="#q32">How do I use escrow at Just-Dice?</a></h4><p>Just-Dice has a built-in escrow feature. After negotiating a trade with another user, you can put some of your balance into escrow for that user. Just-Dice will tell him that you have escrowed the coins, and will hold them until either you release the coins to him (presumably because he has paid you for the CLAMs you escrowed), or until he cancels the escrow (which returns the coins to your balance). The currencies currently available for trade using this system are BTC, LTC and DOGE. BTC is used in the following examples.</p><p>There are 4 commands related to escrow. Two of them are used by the <b>seller</b> of CLAMs:</p><ul><li><p>To escrow some coins, type: <span>/escrow &lt;uid&gt; &lt;clam_amount&gt; &lt;btc_amount&gt; &lt;currency&gt; &lt;address&gt; [2fa]</span>. That will put <span>&lt;clam_amount&gt;</span> coins into escrow for user <span>&lt;uid&gt;</span>, and send him a message telling him to send <span>&lt;btc_amount&gt;</span> of <span>&lt;currency&gt;</span> to <span>&lt;address&gt;</span>.</p><p><b>Example</b>: <span>/escrow 1234 10.0 0.07 BTC 19Zmw5kMbkTjA7qRUdUEiwLqgRaMRRLDkh</span> will put 10.0 CLAM into escrow for user 1234, and request that he sends 0.07 BTC to the given BTC address to release the coins.</p></li><li><p>Once the buyer has paid and the seller is satisfied that the payment is real and sufficiently confirmed he types:<span>/release &lt;uid&gt; [2fa]</span> where <span>&lt;uid&gt;</span> is the userid of the buyer. The coins will then be transferred to the buyer's balance.</p><p><b>Example</b>: <span>/release 1234</span> will release the 10.0 CLAM in escrow for user 1234 into his balance.</p></li></ul><p>For both of the above commands, the 6 digit <span>[2FA]</span> code is required if the seller has 2FA enabled for withdrawals.</p><p>The other two commands are for the <b>buyer</b> of CLAMs:</p><ul><li><p>Once the buyer has paid, he can type:<span>/paid &lt;uid&gt; &lt;txid&gt;</span> where <span>&lt;uid&gt;</span> is the userid of the seller and <span>&lt;txid&gt;</span> is the transaction ID of the payment just made. This optional step informs the buyer of the transaction ID, prompting him to check the payment and then release the escrowed coins to the buyer.</p><p><b>Example</b>: <span>/paid 2345 1e4f9375daf1e4f9375daf1e4f9375daf1e4f9375daf4f9375daf1e4f9375daf</span> informs user 2345 that the buyer claims to have paid for his CLAMs and gives him a link to the transaction on a block explorer.</p></li><li><p>If the buyer decides not to buy the CLAMs, he should type:<span>/cancel &lt;uid&gt; [reason]</span> where <span>&lt;uid&gt;</span> is the userid of the seller. That will cancel the escrow and return the coins to the seller's balance. The <span>[reason]</span> is free form text, and will be relayed to the seller.</p><p><b>Example</b>: <span>/cancel 2345 drop to 0.068 BTC and you have a deal</span></p></li></ul><h4><a name="a31" href="#q31">Can I advertise on Just-Dice?</a></h4><p>Maybe. We do not accept ads for other gambling sites, or scams.</p><p>There are two 468x60 banner ads at the top of the page. On page load two ads are chosen to be displayed. Ads are selected based on how well funded they are. If you are paying 1 CLAM per day for your ad and the total pool is paying 10 CLAMs per day you will have a 10% chance of your ad appearing in each slot.</p><p>
                    To have your ad included on site, email <span>
                        <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="50343f3f377e3a2523243439333510373d31393c7e333f3d">[email&#160;protected]</a>
                        <script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function (t, e, r, n, c, a, p) { try { t = document.currentScript || function () { for (t = document.getElementsByTagName('script'), e = t.length; e--;) if (t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash')) return t[e] }(); if (t && (c = t.previousSibling)) { p = t.parentNode; if (a = c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')) { for (e = '', r = '0x' + a.substr(0, 2) | 0, n = 2; a.length - n; n += 2) e += '%' + ('0' + ('0x' + a.substr(n, 2) ^ r).toString(16)).slice(-2); p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)), c) } p.removeChild(t) } } catch (u) { } }()/* ]]> */</script>
                    </span> with a 468x60 banner (150kB or less) and a target URL. You can also provide a short identifier for the ad.
                </p><p>Once the ad is on the list you can fund it. Go to the chat tab, type <span>/ad list</span> to find your ad's number, then use <span>/ad fund</span> to fund it. You need to provide the ad number (with the #), the number of days you want to fund it for, and the amount of CLAMs per day to fund it with. Include a decimal point in the CLAM-per-day amount to avoid confusion with the number of days. If you have 2FA enabled for withdrawals you will also need to provide your current 6 digit 2FA code.</p><p>Example: to increase funding of ad #8 for 28 days by 10.0 CLAMs per day, use <span>/ad fund #8 28 10.0</span>. If you have 2FA enabled for withdrawals, you'll need to include your 6 digit 2FA code on the end of that line.</p><h4><a name="a29" href="#q29">My CLAM wallet is taking forever to sync. Can I speed it up?</a></h4><p>Yes. See <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=623147.msg9772191#msg9772191" target="_blank">this forum post</a> about bootstrap.dat. Download the bootstrap file, put it in the same folder as your CLAM wallet.dat, and restart your CLAM client. The client will take an hour or so to import the bootstrap file, and will rename it to 'bootstrap.dat.old' when it has finished. Once it has been renamed, you can delete it.</p><h4><a name="a4" href="#q4">How do I deposit?</a></h4><p>Before depositing, please confirm that this type of gambling is legal in your jurisdiction.</p><p>Then, and only then, click the 'deposit' button.  It is in the top right.  This is the most frequently asked question by far.  I guess people just don't expect it to be on a button.  Your deposit needs ten confirmations on the CLAM network before it will be credited to your account. Each confirmation takes around 1 minute on average.</p><p>The wallet was reset on 9th February 2016.  Using old deposit addresses from before then will cause your deposit to be delayed.  If you deposit to an old address accidentally, please wait 24 hours for it to be credited to your account.  If it do not show up within 24 hours then please <a href="#a21">contact us</a> giving your userid (from the account tab).</p><h4><a name="a5" href="#q5">How do I withdraw?</a></h4><p>There is a 'withdraw' button next to the 'deposit' button.  You will need to wait until your most recent deposit has enough confirmations before you are allowed to withdraw.  The number required is the number of digits in the integer part of the number you get when you square the amount you are withdrawing.  So a 31 CLAM withdrawal needs 3 confirmations (31 * 31 = 961) and a 32 CLAM withdrawal needs 4 confirmations (32 * 32 = 1024).</p><p>Please note that for security purposes there are limited coins available for automatic withdrawal. On attempt to withdraw more than is available, your request will fail but will be logged. Please follow up with an email to the address at the end of this FAQ confirming the amount and the destination address. Your withdrawal will then be processed manually. Support in these matters usually occurs within a few hours, but can take up to 24 hours during exceptional circumstances. Thank you for your patience in this matter as it is difficult to balance convenience and security.</p><h4><a name="a6" href="#q6">How does the game work?</a></h4><p>To play:</p><ul><li>select a<span>chance to win</span></li><li>set the<span>bet size</span></li><li>click<span>roll hi</span>or<span>roll lo</span>depending on whether you think your roll will be high or low (or hit<span>H</span>or<span>L</span>on the keyboard; the dark rectangles on the buttons indicate keyboard shortcuts)</li></ul><p>Each time you roll the dice, you get a number between 0 and 100.</p><p>When rolling low, you need to roll less than the chance you selected.  When rolling high, you need to roll (100 - chance) or over.</p><p>So with a 30% chance to win, low rolls win with less than 30, and high rolls win with 70 or more.</p><p>Alternatively, you can select the<span>payout</span>multiplier and the<span>chance to win</span>will be calculated for you.</p><p>Also, you can select the<span>profit</span>you want to make if you win, and the<span>bet size</span>will be calculated for you.</p><h4><a name="a8" href="#q8">What is the max profit?</a></h4><p>The<span>max profit</span>indicator tells you how much the house is prepared to risk per roll, and is based on the size of the house bankroll.  This amount remains unchanged whatever your chance of winning.  It adjusts in real time as the house bankroll grows or shrinks..</p><p class="hide">For example, suppose the<span>max profit</span>is 500 CLAM:<ul><li>You can bet up to 500 CLAM with a 2x multiplier (49.5% chance to win) to double your money.</li><li>Or you could bet up to 10 CLAM with a 51x multiplier (1.94% chance to win) for a return of 510 CLAM and so a profit of 500 CLAM.</li><li>At the other end of the spectrum you could bet up to 49000 CLAM with a 1.0102x multiplier (98% chance to win) for a return of 49500 CLAM and a profit of 500 CLAM.</li></ul></p><h4><a name="a9" href="#q9">How about 'luck'?</a></h4><p>The<span>luck</span>percentage displayed shows how many rolls you have won compared to how many you 'should' have won.  For example, if you play 10 times with a 10% chance of winning and win two of the 10 rolls, your luck will show as 200%, since you have won twice as many as you 'should' have.  Bet size is not taken into account when calculating luck, so it is possible to have a luck less than 100% and still show a profit if your winning bets risked more than your losing bets.</p><p class="hide">For example, suppose you are playing with a 50% chance to win (ie. a 1.98x payout).  You bet 1 CLAM and lose.  You double up to 2 CLAM and lose again.  You double again and lose 4 CLAM, and then double one more time to 8 CLAM and win.  You have played 4 times and won once.  Your luck shows as 50% since you have won half as many games as you would expect to with a 50% chance of winning, but your profit is positive.  You have lost 1+2+4 = 7 CLAM and won 0.98*8 = 7.84 CLAM for a profit of 0.84 CLAM.</p><h4><a name="a10" href="#q10">What do the colors mean in the bet list?</a></h4><p>The number in the<span>profit</span>column is:</p><ul><li>green if the player won, and</li><li>red if they lost.</li></ul><p>The number in the<span>lucky</span>column is:</p><ul><li>green if the player won,</li><li>red if they would have won if they had made the opposite bet (<span>hi</span>vs<span>lo</span>), and</li><li>a golden brown color if they would have won whichever way they rolled given the<span>chance to win</span>they had chosen, and</li><li>grey if there was no way they could have won whichever way they rolled.</li></ul><h4><a name="a11" href="#q11">Can I use my balance here to play on SatoshiDice etc.?</a></h4><p>In order to keep as few coins online as possible, Just-Dice uses a shared hot-wallet.  Most deposits are moved off site soon after being received.  Consequently when you withdraw you are often sent funds that somebody else recently deposited.</p><p>Because of this, if you use your Just-Dice account to send bets to such sites, any winnings are unlikely to be credited to your Just-Dice account.</p><p>tl;dr No!</p><h4><a name="a28" href="#q28">Is there a way of betting automatically?</a></h4><p>There is no built-in "bot" feature yet. There are two third-party Google Chrome addons that you might find useful: "<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-dice-enhancement/oeioapfhdicebkohijoeejgkfmdeocbn" target="_blank">Just-dice enhancement</a>" by Nixsy and "<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/madrollerss-dice-system/hnnfcleekgamnkkpgfjhejhgjikfmcgc" target="_blank">MadRollers's Dice System</a>" by themadroller. Use them at your own risk; we have not audited their code and can not vouch for their safety. By installing these extensions you are giving them permission to access information in all your Chrome tabs. There's also "<a href="https://github.com/seuntie900/DiceBot" target="_blank">DiceBot</a>" by Seuntjie, which is a standalone .NET program. The same applies re. "use at your own risk".</p><p>Please be aware that there are scammers out there who want to steal your CLAMs. Don't download random programs from sites promising magical ways of winning. They probably just want to steal your password and your coins.</p><h4><a name="a13" href="#q13">Can I get a refund?</a></h4><p>All bets are final.  The site operates with a very small house edge.  Refunding bets would turn the site's positive expectation into a negative one.</p><p>Deb wrote <a href="http://just-dice.blogspot.ca/2014/01/no-refunds-no-exceptions.html" target="_blank">a blog post about this</a>.</p><h4><a name="a14" href="#q14">I've been asked to sign a message with my address.  How do I do that?</a></h4><p>In order to prove that you own an account, you will sometimes be asked to sign a message using the address from which you deposited.  How you do that depends which wallet you are using:</p><ul><li>If you are using clam-qt, go to the 'receive' tab, select the address, click 'sign message', type a message in the large middle textarea, click 'sign message', and copy/paste the address, the message, and the signature.  Here is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JAbGy4h.png" target="_blank">screenshot</a>.</li></ul><h4><a name="a15" href="#q15">What if I can't stop?</a></h4><p>Like all forms of gambling, online gambling can become an addiction that can have serious negative effects on your life.  If you lose more than you planned to or can safely afford and find yourself struggling to control time and/or money spent gambling, please check these sites for information that could help you:</p><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.helpguide.org/mental/gambling_addiction.php">http://www.helpguide.org/mental/gambling_addiction.php</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/">http://www.ncpgambling.org/help-treatment/</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.youthgambling.com/">http://www.youthgambling.com/</a></li></ul><p>Games of chance (like Just-Dice) have no memory between consecutive rounds, so increasing the amount you wager after a streak of losses has no effect on the odds of winning the next round.</p><p>You can also use the box found at the bottom of the "Account" tab to have a "cool-off" period during which you cannot gamble.  "When rolling, delay my results ...".  There is no limit to the number of seconds you can input, but it will only 'last' until the next server reboot, at which time you will need to input your delay again.</p><p>Also, if you are an investor on the site and want your account to be permanently blocked from betting, email the address found towards the bottom of this FAQ and ask to be added to the list of accounts that are not allowed to bet.</p><h4><a name="a17" href="#q17">Is this site a scam or Ponzi scheme?  Is it insolvent?</a></h4><p>If the site was doing something simple like refusing to pay out winners, then everyone would have heard about it already.</p><p>The dice rolls are provably fair.  This is addressed on the 'Fair?' tab on site.</p><p>As I see it, there are two non-obvious ways the site could be scamming people:</p><ul>
                    <li>(a) We could be under-reporting the amount invested.  As an investor, you can check this is not the case by looking at the <a target="_blank" href="http://just-dice.blogspot.ca/search/label/bankroll">list of investor balances</a> which is updated each Sunday.  Each investor can check that the list includes their invested amount.</li><!-- http://khashier.com/chain/Clam/q/addressbalance/xJDCLAMZ3Y7L5XQBfW85dY8SoKWLgovNtZ--><!-- http://khashier.com/chain/Clam/q/addressbalance/xJDCLAMZ1fHokJhMVTGRySSVPzCR3Kv3TH-->
                    <li>(b) We could be spending invested coins.  You can check this is not the case by comparing the site's total invested amount with the sum of the balances of the site's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/CLAM/address.php?address=xJDCLAMZ3Y7L5XQBfW85dY8SoKWLgovNtZ">hot</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/CLAM/address.php?address=xJDCLAMZ1fHokJhMVTGRySSVPzCR3Kv3TH">staking</a> wallets.<p>We signed messages to prove that we control those addresses:</p></li>

                </ul><p>The above two together should be enough to prove that (a) we don't hide any investments, and (b) we are in control of all invested coins.  In conclusion, the site is not running a "fractional reserve" operation and is in fact solvent.  If you see any way the site could still be running in "Ponzi" mode given the above, please let us know and we will attempt to provide further proof.</p><h4><a name="a18" href="#q18">Show me some milestone bets?</a></h4><p>You can't just put a question mark on the end of a sentence to make it a question you know?  But <a target="_blank" href="/misc/milestones.htm">here they are</a>.</p><h4><a name="a23" href="#q23">How does this guy win every 5% bet?</a></h4><p>The 'all bets' tab doesn't really show all bets; there are too many bets to show them all.  It shows all bets which risk, win, or lose an amount of 0.05 CLAM or more.  (This number is subject to change).  If no bets have met that criteria for 3 seconds, then the next bet that happens will be shown, regardless of its size.  So when someone is betting 0.01 CLAM at 5% over and over, his losses mostly won't show up, since he's only risking and losing 0.01 CLAM, but all his winnings WILL show up, since he'll be winning something like 0.20 CLAM.  That's why it sometimes looks like people are winning low chance bets over and over.</p><p>Note that the same reasoning also explains why you sometimes see people having very long losing streaks at high chances to win; their wins at high chance are too low to show up, but their losses are big enough to show.</p><h4><a name="a24" href="#q24">How can I tip you?</a></h4><p>People often offer to tip me for running the site.  In the past I've mostly said "you don't need to tip me; I make plenty from commission", but have accepted a few offers.  I've been making judgements about whether the person could afford to tip me or whether they felt obliged to, which isn't fair given that in general I have nothing to go on in making such judgements.  So please, there's no obligation to tip me at all, but if you want to, my BTC address is <a target="_blank" href="http://blockchain.info/address/1DooGLUSx1QjYpSB8GEiMtbrGDtkmRV4kx">1DooGLUSx1QjYpSB8GEiMtbrGDtkmRV4kx</a> and my CLAM address is <a target="_blank" href="http://khashier.com/address/xDoogLusZTyYF45mwy3BwNp2rnGCmV2R9j">xDoogLusZTyYF45mwy3BwNp2rnGCmV2R9j</a>.</p><h4><a name="a20" href="#q20">There's a "dooglus" in the chat.  Is he the real one?</a></h4><p>Usually dooglus has a (1) in front of his name, and Deb has a (2).  The passwords for these accounts are very long randomly generated strings that are quite impossible to memorise.  So when out of the house, dooglus uses account (111) which also has chat name 'dooglus'.  That account has no admin privileges, and very limited funds available, so it is safe to use on untrusted computers.  The password on that account is long, but short enough to carry in a human head.  If you see user (111) claiming to be dooglus, it probably is.  No other user should be able to change their name to 'dooglus', although variations on the theme are allowed.</p><h4><a name="a25" href="#q25">What commands are available in the chat?  Is it IRC?</a></h4><p>The list of commands changes occasionally, but is always available by typing /help in the chat.  It's not an IRC chat, it's just something built into the website.</p><h4><a name="a21" href="#q21">How can I contact you?</a></h4><p>
